# Introduction

In this repository you can find my first project built with JavaScript, HTML & CSS. I really enjoyed making it because I love Pok√©mon, and that gave me a lot of motivation! Any advice or feedback is appreciate is welcome! It will help to improve and do better my future projects. 

Just one rule: no haters or toxic behavior. Thanks :)

## Idea and Purpose

I made this project while following a JavaScript course, with the idea of creating a WebPage Dex from **Gen 1 to Gen 9 (with API)**.
